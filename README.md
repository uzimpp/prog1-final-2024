# prog1-final-2024
## How to get started
- Fork and clone this Github repo
- Run the file run_ball.py
```python
python3 run_ball.py
```
Observe the simulation result
- Run the file seven_segments_proc.py
```python
python3 seven_segments_proc.py
```
Observe the simulation result
## What to do in the final exam
- Create a simulation shown in the VDO wanted_outcome.mp4
  - This simulation combines the one generated by run_ball.py with the one generated by seven_segments_proc.py
- The simulation code must be written in object-oriented style
  - You are also required to create a UML class diagram to go with your code
  - You are allowed to use on-line or off-line drawing software to create the class diagram 
- Use the procedural code provided in this repo as a starting point
## What to submit for grading
- Commit all changes to your local and remote repo and submit the Github link to your remote repo to Google Classroom
- Create a report using Google Doc and put the following contents in it
  - Explain if all the code is implemented correctly or you encounter some bugs; describe the bugs in more details so people can understand what you are up to
  - A sample screenshot of your final simulation in the report
  - A UML class diagram of your code
### No report = no scores
## How my work will be graded
- Incorrect result: 0%
- Correct result but not OO code: 0%
- Correct result with an OO coding style as discussed in the class: 100%
- Correct result with a bad OO coding style: 50%
